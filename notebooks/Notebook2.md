# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

This week I mostly focused on the parser combinator. I still have a bit of troubleshooting and progress to make.
Based on feedback I also focused more on the syntax of the DSL, as the feedback mentioned it was vague/not clear
enough. I also realized there were features in calendar apps/schedules which the DSL doesn't have and would probably
make using it easier if it had these features.

## Description

This week I focused on finding a parser combinator library that would work well with my syntax within Python,
Figuring out what features might be missing that I'd want to incorporate, and implementing the parser.
To this extent I'm using the Parsita library in Python. I still have some parsers to write and figure out, but
I should be able to get that done in this week soon.

## Questions

The most pressing issue currently is getting the parser working. I think I'm just running into problems trying to
get the parser library working/reading the documentation/troubleshooting. I don't think there's any design decisions
I need to make right now.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

What are some resources for learning Parsita/Regex if you know any. 

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

This week I probably spent ~8 hours. 

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**

I think this week did not go too well! I was a bit busy this week and did not put in enough time
for this week, and because of that the parser is not done yet.
