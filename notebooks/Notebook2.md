# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critique you received for
last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did the feedback help
improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer something you hadn't considered?
Did it help you make a design decision? Was it helpful in addressing the most pressing
issues in your project? How will you incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you
change something about the design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

This week I mostly focused on the parser combinator. I still have a bit of troubleshooting and progress to make.
Based on feedback I also focused more on the syntax of the DSL, as the feedback mentioned it was vague/not clear
enough. I also realized there were features in calendar apps/schedules which the DSL doesn't have and would probably
make using it easier if it had these features.

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

This week I focused on finding a parser combinator library that would work well with my syntax within Python,
Figuring out what features might be missing that I'd want to incorporate, and implementing the parser.
To this extent I'm using the Parsita library in Python. I still have some parsers to write and figure out, but
I should be able to get that done in this week soon.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The most pressing issue currently is getting the parser working. I think I'm just running into problems trying to
get the parser library working/reading the documentation/troubleshooting. I don't think there's any design decisions
I need to make right now.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

What are some resources for learning Parsita/Regex if you know any. 

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

This week I probably spent ~8 hours. 

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**

I think this week did not go too well! I was a bit busy this week and did not put in enough time
for this week, and because of that the parser is not done yet.
